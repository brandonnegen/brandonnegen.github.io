    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring Front End developer in the process of learning 
      <strong>HTML</strong>
      , 
      <strong>CSS</strong>
      , and 
      <strong>Java</strong>
      . I absolutely love all things about technology. That passion gives me a constant motivation to learn more about developement and continue to better my skillset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honesty and an eagerness to ask questions are probably the two most important things to me, but golf comes in a close third! In order to succeed at anything I believe you need to be brutally honest with yourself about your abilities and knowledge. When you have that type of honesty with yourself I find that you can start asking the right questions that will help you learn and move forward.

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Minnesota but spent most of early life in Omaha, Nebraska. After a brief stint on the western edge of North Dakota my family and I decided it was time to move back to Minnesota. We've been in Minneapolis for the past few years and are loving every minute of it!

    <h1> More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are you favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>
      The two hobbies that keep me most occupied are video games and golf. Golf tends to take up most of my time in the summer and I've gotten pretty good over the past few years. I currently have a 2.3 handicap. Gaming on my pc is something I take a lot of pleasure in as well. For me the actually gaming is fun but a big part of the enjoyment comes from constantly tweeking and upgrading my rig to squeeze as much performance out of it as I can.
    </p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>
      I have every intention to owning my own business after several years learning the ropes and honing my skills in Front End development. Being able to eventually merge my growing knowledge in development and software with the hobbies I am passionate about is something most people dream about and I hope to make happen.

    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>
      I occassionally listen to a Spotify playlist or two but most of my listening entertainment comes from podcasts. Right now I have several favorites. 
      <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com">Hardcore History</a>
      by Dan Carlin is probably the best podcast ever created. The way he breaks down history and includes the complex relations of politics, personal stories, and facts all the while keeping the listener absolutely enthralled is an artform Dan has perfected. Other podcasts that occupy my time are 
      <a href="http://www.joerogan.net">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>
      , the 
      <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com">Giant Bombcast</a>
      , Rebel FM, and 
      <a href="http://www.yourmomshousepodcast.com">Your Mom's House</a>
      just to name a few.
